# C-Reply
This is the code used to run the simulations in the reply by Grabowski et al. (2023) - A Cautionary Note on â€œA Cautionary Note on the Use of Ornstein Uhlenbeck Models in Macroevolutionary Studies - _Systematic Biology_

## How to run the code under `scripts`

The scripts can be run line-by-line, or as a script from the terminal. For example, using `Rscript scripts/ou_inference_measurement_error.R`. If you open the script in an IDE (like Rstudio), the script will assume that the working directory (`setwd("path/to/dir")`) is the top-level of this repository. The images are saved under `figures` but are not committed.
